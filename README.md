# Coin flipping dApp

## Local Setup Instructions

- Checkout the [frontend repo README](/dapp)
- Checkout the [contracts repo README](/dapp)

## App Requirements

1. As a user, I should be able to bet crypto on whether a coin flips heads or tails.The app should allow the user to:

   - Input a bet amount
   - Pick Heads or Tails
   - See the potential reward
   - Pay to confirm the bet

2. Once the user has paid and bet, the app should flip a coin and record the outcome.
3. Depending on the outcome, the app shall:
4. Pay the reward to the user (if the user won)
5. Do nothing (if the user lost) - except perhaps showing a "You lose" message, or something along those lines.
